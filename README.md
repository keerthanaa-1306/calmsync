### Project Description
CalmSync – A web-based mental wellness app offering guided breathing, mood tracking, calming activities, and supportive AI chat to help users manage stress and regain emotional balance.

### The Problem statement
In today’s fast-paced and demanding world, many people struggle with stress, anxiety, frustration, or sadness without having immediate access to supportive, non-judgmental tools to help them cope. When emotions go unprocessed, they can build up and negatively affect overall well-being. CalmSync bridges this gap with a simple, user-friendly web application designed for real-time emotional support. It guides users through emotional check-ins, offers calming activities such as breathing exercises and relaxing games, and provides supportive AI interactions to help individuals reset, regain clarity, and build emotional resilience whenever they need it.


### The Solution
CalmSync addresses the lack of accessible emotional support by offering a structured, interactive web application that helps users process their feelings in a private and guided way. The platform follows a progressive flow, beginning with a warm welcome, moving into mood check-ins, and providing personalized validation messages. Users can then choose supportive activities such as guided breathing exercises, calming games, AI-powered conversations, or symbolic “burn it away” interactions to release negative thoughts. Built with modern web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and designed with an intuitive user experience, CalmSync delivers instant, stigma-free access to mental wellness tools directly through a browser—no downloads or subscriptions required. By lowering barriers and encouraging consistent engagement, the app supports emotional regulation and fosters long-term mental resilience through repeated, positive interactions.

When a user opens CalmSync, they are greeted with a calm welcome screen and a simple “Start” option. The app then guides them to select their current mood, encouraging emotional awareness. Based on their choice, it provides a supportive validation message to acknowledge their feelings.

Users can then choose a calming activity such as guided breathing, a relaxing mini-game, AI-style supportive chat, or a symbolic “burn it away” feature to release negative thoughts. The app works directly in the browser without login or downloads, offering a private, simple space to reset and feel calmer.
